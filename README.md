🔧 How It Works
When the page loads, a random 6-character CAPTCHA is generated and displayed.

The user inputs the CAPTCHA into the text field.

Clicking the Check button compares the input with the displayed CAPTCHA.

If matched, a success message is shown and a new CAPTCHA is generated after 4 seconds.

If not matched, an error message is displayed.

The Reload button allows users to generate a new CAPTCHA.
