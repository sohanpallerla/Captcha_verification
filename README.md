# Captcha_verification

This project is a custom CAPTCHA implementation designed to protect websites and applications from bots by verifying whether a user is human or not. It uses various techniques such as distorted text, image recognition, or math problems to generate challenges that require user interaction.

Features
Text-based CAPTCHA: Generates random distorted text images that users must read and enter correctly.
Math-based CAPTCHA: Presents simple math problems (e.g., 5 + 3) that users must solve.
Image CAPTCHA: Uses image-based challenges like selecting all images with traffic lights or animals.
Customizable Difficulty: Allows the challenge difficulty to be adjusted to make it easier or harder for users.
Secure and Robust: Ensures that bots are unable to bypass the verification process, protecting the site from automated abuse.
Responsive Design: Ensures the CAPTCHA challenges work seamlessly across different devices, including mobile and desktop.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the CAPTCHA form and layout.
CSS: For styling the CAPTCHA challenge and UI elements.
JavaScript: For generating dynamic CAPTCHA images and handling user input.
Python (optional): For backend integration and verifying CAPTCHA responses on the server.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/captcha-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd captcha-project
Open the project in a browser or run the server (if applicable) to view the CAPTCHA in action.

How It Works
The project generates CAPTCHA challenges (text, math problems, or images) each time a user visits the page.
The user interacts with the challenge, enters their response, and submits it for verification.
On the backend, the CAPTCHA response is validated to ensure it matches the challenge, thus confirming the user is human.
Future Enhancements
Integrate CAPTCHA with popular backend frameworks like Django or Flask for server-side verification.
Add more complex CAPTCHA challenges, such as puzzle-solving or logical reasoning.
Improve accessibility features for users with disabilities, like audio CAPTCHA or voice recognition.
