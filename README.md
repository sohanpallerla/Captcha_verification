## 🔧 How It Works

1. When the page loads, a random 6-character CAPTCHA is generated and displayed.  
2. The user inputs the CAPTCHA into the text field.  
3. Clicking the **Check** button compares the input with the displayed CAPTCHA.  
4. If matched, a success message is shown and a new CAPTCHA is generated after 4 seconds.  
5. If not matched, an error message is displayed.  
6. The **Reload** button allows users to generate a new CAPTCHA.
